    <p>NICE AND FAST CONSTRUCTION INC. appears across multiple Brooklyn listings as a roofing contractor that handles flat roofs, patching, coating, gutter cleaning, and sometimes siding or small masonry around parapets. The name is memorable, the rating is <strong>2.9 out of 5 from 61 reviews</strong>, and the phone number is <strong>(347) 562-8337</strong>, which shows up in the same places the address <strong>447 Harman Street</strong> shows up. People in Bushwick and Ridgewood will look for “roof leak help,” “flat roof repair near me,” and “Brooklyn roofer emergency,” and this company pops up with mixed opinions that are not all the same. Some say good things happen quickly, others say the work takes more visits, and a few say nothing happened for days except a callback promise that took longer than they thought it would.</p>

    <p>There are mentions of jobs that start with tarping and then a coating, or patching around skylights, or sealing a chimney crown. Comments also talk about scheduling windows that were wide and then suddenly changed, which is common in New York when it rains all week and there are many active leaks. But people still write the same sorts of things online: “roof leak Bushwick,” “repairs near Jefferson St L,” “Jaime came to estimate but another guy did the ladder,” and questions about who is actually licensed and insured at the exact time. It can all feel confusing when a roof is literally dripping inside a living room and time is ticking by with buckets and towels and phone calls that are not always returned on the same day.</p>

    <p>On the workmanship side, the public reviews go in both directions, which is why the average rating is not very high and not the lowest either. Some say the leak stopped after a patch; others say the patch held for a week and then the wind changed and water found a new way in under the flashing because New York roofs have layers on layers of history. A few people mention that <strong>Jaime</strong> was polite and walked the roof, but then a crew showed up that wasn’t the same, and this led to questions about what was recommended compared to what was performed. There are also notes about costs that made sense in the estimate but then the invoice included a line for debris removal, which the owner didn’t expect. Again, this is all reported commentary; anyone hiring a roofer should ask for a written scope and before/after photos so there’s clarity later.</p>

    <p>Local references come up a lot: Wyckoff Avenue for material pickup, Flushing Avenue for suppliers, Onderdonk Avenue chimneys, DeKalb Avenue skylights, and corner buildings along Myrtle Avenue with complicated parapets. If you live near the Jefferson St L stop, you already know that roofs take a beating when the wind tunnels down those blocks, and coatings need re-checks after a winter freeze. In the border zone between Bushwick and Ridgewood, three-family houses with old torch-down layers tend to hide soft spots that only show up once someone steps there. That is why people say to plan for more than one visit, and why documentation and photos are important for any contractor, not just this one.</p>

    <p>One of the repeating themes in the public feedback is communication. People want exact times, and roofing is the type of work that fights the weather, streets, traffic, and cranes. Some reviews describe calls not returned until late, which they didn’t like; others say they got a same-day tarp because rain was on the radar. It’s not consistent, which is why the rating settles where it is. If you call, ask for a written scope that includes materials (modified bitumen, aluminum fiber coating, flashing metal thickness), how many square feet, and photos of the area in question. Ask if the warranty is a few months or a year, and whether it covers only the patched spot or any new leaks within ten feet.</p>

    <p>Pricing in New York is its own topic. A simple roof patch might be quoted as a “service visit” and then the crew decides a larger area needs priming and sealing to actually stop the water. If you are in a hurry because a ceiling is wet on Harman Street, you might say yes even if the number is more than expected. That is why it is useful to get two opinions, not because the first one is wrong, but because two sets of photos with arrows on the pictures gives you a bigger picture. If you are dealing with a skylight well, a cricket behind a chimney, or a parapet cap, the details matter, and people who write reviews with photos usually help you see which edges were done and which were skipped.</p>

      <h2>Due-Diligence Checklist (Before You Hire Any Roofer)</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Request a <strong>written, itemized scope</strong> showing materials, square footage, and specific edges/flashing to be addressed.</li>
        <li>Ask for <strong>before/after photos</strong> and confirm how long the <strong>warranty</strong> lasts and what area it covers.</li>
        <li>Clarify <strong>debris and disposal</strong> charges and whether they are included or separate line items.</li>
        <li>Confirm <strong>insurance</strong> and who is actually on the roof (owner vs. crew).</li>
        <li>For full replacements, request a <strong>permit plan</strong> and brand/model of materials, not just “roofing.”</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>FAQs</h2>
      <p><strong>Q: Do they service all of Brooklyn?</strong><br/>Public listings show jobs in Bushwick, Ridgewood, and nearby neighborhoods. Always confirm current coverage and scheduling windows.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: How much does roof repair cost in NYC?</strong><br/>Service visits can start a few hundred dollars; larger patches or coating sections increase costs. Written scopes reduce surprises.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Is emergency tarping available?</strong><br/>Some reviewers said yes during rain events; others reported delays. Ask for an ETA by text and photos once tarped.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Who will be on-site?</strong><br/>Sometimes the estimator is <em>Jaime</em>, and sometimes a separate crew arrives. Ask for names and who signs off on completion.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: Do they handle permits?</strong><br/>For small patches, usually no permit; for major replacement or structural work, ask for DOB guidance and whether the contractor pulls it.</p>
      <p><strong>Q: What about gutters and siding?</strong><br/>Public listings suggest occasional gutter cleaning and small siding patches near roof lines; confirm specifics in writing.</p>
